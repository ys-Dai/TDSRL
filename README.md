# TDSRL: Time Series Dual Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection from Different Perspectives

There is the code of our paper

## Dataset

We adopt three widely-used benchmarks in time series anomaly task to evaluate our network. We have placed the pre-processed datasets in folder `dataset/pocessed`.

The NeurIPS-TS Benchmark mentioned in our paper can be found at:
