# TDSRL: Time Series Dual Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection from Different Perspectives

There is the code of our paper

## Dataset

We adopt these three widely-used benchmarks in time series anomaly task to evaluate our network: SWaT, SMD, SMAP. We have provided pre-processed datasets and placed them in folder `dataset/pocessed`.
